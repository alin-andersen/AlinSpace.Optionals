# AlinSpace.Zen

This library/framework allows an application to be split into multiple decoupled modules.
It makes testing single components of the application simpler and makes it harder to write spaghetti code.

## Status

Useable, but still under development.

## Dependencies
This library heavily depends on the IoC container library called [DryIoc](https://github.com/dadhi/DryIoc).
